## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Architecture Pattern**
```
Your Hackathon Project MCP Server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Product Hub (existing foundation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Your New Integration (Monte Carlo, DataHub, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AI Enhancement Layer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent Workflow Orchestration
```

### **Development Setup**
```bash
# Start with the current foundation
git clone your-fork/data-product-hub
cd data-product-hub

# Add your new MCP server
cp dbt_server.py your_integration_server.py
# Modify for your chosen integration

# Deploy both servers
# 1. Deploy data-product-hub (existing)
# 2. Deploy your-integration-server (new)
# 3. Configure connection between them
```
