# 🚀 Hackathon: Multi-Platform Data Product Intelligence

**5-Day Team Hackathon Proposal**

---

## 🎯 Goal

Extend **Data Product Hub** into a unified information hub by integrating with data platform MCP servers we have access to (GitHub, Monte Carlo, DataHub, etc.).

 - **Current State:** ✅ Working dbt analysis MCP server
 - **Hackathon Goal:** 🎯 Add data platform integrations for comprehensive data product visibility

---

## 🏗️ What's Been Built (Proven Foundation)

- ✅ **Working MCP server** - Live at `data-product-hub.fastmcp.app/mcp`
- ✅ **GitHub App authentication** with Environment Secrets pattern
- ✅ **8 dbt analysis tools** - Model analysis, metadata coverage, lineage
- ✅ **Repository support** - Works with any GitHub dbt project
- ✅ **FastMCP integration patterns** - Proven deployment and auth flows

---

## 🎯 Target Users

### **Data Product Teams**
- Need to quickly assess health of their data products
- Currently switch between multiple data tools
- Want unified view without replacing existing workflows

### **Platform Teams**
- Support multiple data teams using various data platforms
- Need to understand cross-platform dependencies
- Want centralized visibility for better support

---

## 📋 MVP Scope (Realistic for 5 Days)

### Core Integration Target: **2 Data Platforms**

**Option A: GitHub + Monte Carlo**
- GitHub MCP integration for repo context
- Monte Carlo API for data quality metrics
- Focus: Code changes + data quality correlation

**Option B: GitHub + DataHub**
- GitHub MCP integration for repo context
- DataHub API for metadata and lineage
- Focus: Code changes + metadata completeness

### MVP Features
1. **Unified Status Check** - One command gets insights from all connected platforms
2. **Cross-Platform Correlation** - Link dbt models to external platform data
3. **Environment Secrets Auth** - Extend current pattern to new platforms
4. **Basic Dashboard** - Simple web UI showing aggregated insights

## 🛠️ 5-Day Development Plan

### Day 1: Foundation
- [ ] Set up GitHub MCP client integration
- [ ] Extend Environment Secrets to support `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- [ ] Create basic multi-platform request routing

### Day 2: Second Platform
- [ ] Choose and integrate Monte Carlo OR DataHub
- [ ] Add corresponding Environment Secret support
- [ ] Build correlation logic (dbt model name → platform entity)

### Day 3: Unified Tools
- [ ] `get_unified_data_product_status(model_name, repo_url)`
- [ ] `analyze_cross_platform_health(repo_url)`
- [ ] Error handling and graceful degradation

### Day 4: Demo Prep
- [ ] Basic web dashboard showing aggregated data
- [ ] Test with real company repositories
- [ ] Polish demo scenarios

### Day 5: Polish & Present
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Demo preparation

## 🎪 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Quick Health Check"
```
User: "What's the status of customer_summary model?"

Response:
📊 dbt: ✅ 15 tests passing, ⚠️ 2 missing descriptions
🔄 GitHub: 3 commits this week, 1 open PR
📈 Monte Carlo: ✅ Fresh data, ⚠️ Volume dip yesterday
```

### Scenario 2: "Change Impact"
```
User: "I'm updating user_events schema - what's impacted?"

Response:
🔗 dbt: 8 downstream models affected
📋 DataHub: Used in 12 queries across 3 teams
🔄 GitHub: Last schema change was 3 months ago
```

## 💼 Real Value Proposition

### For Data Product Teams
- ⚡ **Faster health checks** - 30 seconds vs. 10 minutes across tools
- 🔍 **Better context** - See code + data quality + usage together
- 📱 **Single interface** - One place to get data product overview

### For Platform Teams
- 👀 **Centralized visibility** - Help teams without tool-switching
- 🔗 **Dependency understanding** - See cross-platform relationships
- 🛠️ **Better support** - Comprehensive context when helping teams

**What This ISN'T:**
- ❌ Replacement for existing tools
- ❌ New workflow requirements
- ❌ Complex analytics or reporting
- ❌ Production data pipeline changes

**What This IS:**
- ✅ Information aggregation hub
- ✅ Faster troubleshooting and assessment
- ✅ Better context for data product decisions
- ✅ Foundation for future integrations

---

## 🏆 Success Criteria

### Technical
- [ ] 2 new platform integrations working
- [ ] 3-5 new unified tools
- [ ] Environment Secrets auth for all platforms
- [ ] Basic web interface

### Demo
- [ ] Working demo with real company data
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison: manual vs. unified approach
- [ ] 2-3 realistic scenarios showing value

### Outcome
- [ ] Data teams want to use it
- [ ] Platform team sees support value
- [ ] Clear next steps for adoption

## 🚀 Why This Will Work

1. **Proven foundation** - Authentication and MCP patterns already work
2. **Realistic scope** - 2 integrations in 5 days is achievable
3. **Real problem** - Data teams genuinely need this
4. **Clear value** - Faster assessment, better context
5. **Incremental** - Doesn't disrupt existing workflows
